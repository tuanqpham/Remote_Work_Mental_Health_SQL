# Remote_Work_Mental_Health_SQL
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of remote work where professionals were able to perform their work duties from the comfort of their home has become more prevalent. According to an article by ConnexOntario (2023) on the relations between remote work and mental health, while remote work allieviates the commute stress as well as offering more flexibility for workers, this concept may bring about the decline of mental health. In the analysis, the author inditified some common drawbacks of remote work such as high rates of social isolation and lack of mental health resources.

In this project, I will be utilizing a fictional dataset provided on Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health), which contains information on workers' roles, their satisfaction of remote work as well as surrounding conditions. With the dataset, I am hoping to come up with a comprehensive analysis workflow with the following steps:
* Database connection and uploading using relevant frameworks
* Exploring the general demographic of the workers (based on their roles, age, industry, geographical locations and gender)
* Assessing workers' satisfactions using relevant indicators such as work-life balance rate, common mental health illness.
* Visualize results in Tableau.

As part of the project, I am planning to also hone skills in writing SQL queries and (perhaps learn how to write optimized scripts)

### P/S: This project, though may have addressed all of my planned questions, is subject to significant improvement as I advance in my SQL learning journey as well as discover better approaches to my analysis! Therefore, the report is due to improvement at any time :)
